SPARQL kernel
=============

This module installs a Jupyter kernel for `SPARQL`_. It allows sending queries 
to an SPARQL endpoint and fetching & presenting the results in a notebook.

It is implemented as a `Jupyter wrapper kernel`_, by using the Python 
`SPARQLWrapper`_ & `rdflib`_ packages.


Requirements
------------

The kernel has only been tried with Jupyter 4.x. It works with Python 2.7 and
Python 3 (tested with Python 3.5).

The above mentioned `SPARQLWrapper`_ & `rdflib`_ Python packages are required
dependencies (they are marked as such, so they will automatically be installed
with the package if needed).

An optional dependency is `Graphviz`_, needed to create diagrams for RDF result 
graphs (Graphviz's ``dot`` program must be available for that to work).


Installation
------------

You will need Jupyter >= 4.0. The module is installable via ``pip``.

The installation process requires two steps:

1. Install the Python package::

     pip install sparqlkernel

2. Install the kernel into Jupyter::

     jupyter sparqlkernel install [--user] [--logdir <dir>]


The ``--user`` option will install the kernel in the current user's personal
config, while the generic command will install it as a global kernel (but
needs write permissions in the system directories).

Additionally, the ``--logdir <dir>`` option will define the default directory to
use for logfiles (it can be overriden when executing the kernel by defining
the ``LOGDIR`` environment variable). By default it will use the system
temporal directory.

Note that kernel installation also installs some custom CSS and a modification
for a Pygments highlighter; its purpose is to improve the layout of the kernel
results as they are presented in the notebook and to improve conversion to
other formats (HTML). But it also means that the rendered notebook will look 
slightly different in a Jupyter deployment in which the kernel has not been 
installed, or within an online viewer.

The ``examples`` subdirectory contains some notebook examples (again, they will
look slightly different if viewed on a running kernel). They can also be viewed
through the `online Notebook viewer`_.

To uninstall, perform the inverse operations (in reverse order), to uninstall
the kernel from Jupyter and to remove the Python package::

     jupyter sparqlkernel remove
     pip uninstall sparqlkernel



Syntax
------

The kernel implements the standard SPARQL primitives: ``SELECT``, ``ASK``, 
``DESCRIBE``, ``CONSTRUCT``. Once the endpoint is defined (see magics below), 
just write a SPARQL valid query in a cell and execute it; the query will be 
sent to the endpoint and the results printed out.

The kernel features keyword autocompletion (TAB key), as well as contextual 
help (Shift-TAB). This is unfinished work: completion is currently done as 
isolated SPARQL keywords (no SPARQL syntax context is used) and only a few 
keywords have contextual help, as of now. 

It also installs menu entries in the HELP menu pointing to SPARQL documentation.


Output format
-------------

The query results are displayed in the notebook as cell results; there are a 
number of choices for the display format, controlled via magics (see below).

Each SPARQL query is immediately launched, once the results are printed out it 
is forgotten. Cells are thus completely independent from each other (except for
magics, which are persistent).


Magics
------

A number of line magics (lines starting with ``%``) can be used to control the 
kernel behaviour. These line magics must be placed at the start of the cell, 
and there can be more than one per cell.
Valid combinations are thus:

* a cell with only a SPARQL query,
* a cell consisting only of magics,
* and a cell containing both magics and then a SPARQL query (but after the 
  first SPARQL keyword the cell is assumed to be in SPARQL mode, and line 
  magics will *not* be recognized as such).

Comment lines (lines starting with ``#`` or any sequence of spaces plus ``#``)
can be freely interspersed between line magics or SPARQL queries.

Magics also feature autocompletion and contextual help. Furthermore, there is 
a special magic ``%lsmagics``; when executed on a cell it will output the list 
of all currently available magics. The same info can be obtained by requesting
contextual help (i.e. Shift-TAB) on a line containing only a percent sign.

A few of the most relevant magics are explained in the following sections. The 
complete set is always available in the notebook, by using the help or 
autocompletion features.


``%endpoint``
.............

This magic is special in the sense that it is compulsory: there needs to be an 
endpoint defined *before* the first SPARQL query is launched, otherwise the 
query will fail.

Its syntax is::

    %endpoint <url>

and it simply defines the SPARQL endpoint for all subsequent queries. 
It remains active until superseded by another ``%endpoint`` magic.


``%qparam``
...........

Define a custom additional parameter to be sent with every query. Its syntax
is::

  %qparam <name> <value>

and it will add the ``name=value`` parameter to every subsequent query (it can
be used e.g. to send API keys, or any parameter required by the endpoint).

Any number of parameters can be defined; they will all be added to the queries
executed after their definitions. To remove a parameter, use a line with no
value::

  %qparam <name>


``%header``
............
Adds a certain header to each sparql queries. This can be used to set some 
(potentially non SPARQL) command in the query. For instance virtuoso endpoints 
accept the _define_ keyword which can be used to trigger the server reasoner.


``%returnrawquery``
............
To be used with the 'On' or 'Off' keyword to activate or deactivate.

Will skip the server query and directly print out the full SPARQL query text including its headers, prefixes.
This allows to construct a SPARQL query using the sparql-kernel and finally retrieve the full query (or debug
it using the SPARQL query validator, etc.).

``%shorthand``
............
Allows to define shorthands which get replaced in the SPARQL query. Its syntax is::

    %shorthand shortcut replaced_string

Ex. "%shorthand label rdfs:label" will replace any string "label" in the query with
"rdfs:label".

``%outfile``
...........

Allows to write to a file the raw answer from the server. Its syntax is::

   %outfile absolut_path_to_file

"%outfile NONE" will deactivate this.


``%auth``
...........

Define HTTP authentication to send to the backend. Its syntax is::

   %auth (basic | digest) <username> <password>

Once defined, it will be sent to the backend on every subsequent query. To
remove a defined authentication, just use::

   %auth none

  
``%format``
............

Sets the data format requested to the SPARQL endpoint::

    %format JSON | XML | N3  | any | default

where:

* ``JSON`` requests *application/sparql-results+json* format
* ``XML`` requests *application/sparql-results+xml* format
* ``N3`` requests the endpoint to provide results in *text/rdf+n3* format
* ``any`` lets the endpoint return any format it pleases (note that if the
  returned format is not JSON, XML or N3, it will be rendered as raw text)
* ``default`` selects a default format depending on the requested SPARQL
  operation (N3 for ``DESCRIBE`` and ``CONSTRUCT``, JSON for ``SELECT``, *any*
  for the rest)


``%display``
............

Sets the output rendering shape::

    %display raw | table [withtypes] | diagram [svg|png] [withliterals]

There are three possible display formats:

* ``raw`` outputs the literal text returned by the SPARQL endpoint, in the
  format that was requested (see ``%format`` magic)
* ``table`` generates a table with the result. The optional ``withtypes``
  modifier adds to each column an additional column that shows the data
  type for each value
* ``diagram`` takes the RDF graph returned (makes sense only for N3 result
  format) and generates an image with a rendering of the graph. For it to
  work, the ``dot`` program from GraphViz must be available in the search path.
  The modifier selects the image format. Default is SVG, which usually works
  much better (PNG quality is lower, image size is fixed and cannot contain
  hyperlinks).

Default is ``table``. Note that if the result format is not a supported format
for a table or diagram representation (i.e. it is not JSON/XML or N3), then raw
format will be used.
